Hello I'm Anirudh welcome to my project
Basically what this project does is it will crack the password for a zip file
In this folder you can see a file named rockyou.txt which I found on this website
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt?resource=download

This file contains approximately 15,000,000 which are most commonly used by people
The password which are there in the file is used by 32,603,388 accounts

what this program does is it will open the target zip file and tries all the passwords in the rockyou.txt file and if
the password is found it will return the password
Here in this program I have used built in libray named zipfile
